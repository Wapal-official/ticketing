      >
    </h1>
    <p>
      Wapal is a No Code NFT Creator Studio on the Aptos Blockchain. Wapal
      hereinafter referred as
      <strong> “Platform” or “Service” or “we” or “us” </strong>is powered by
      NFT Mint Candy Machine Smart Contract, an open-source and audited smart
      contract developed by Mokshya Protocol.
    </p>
    <h2 class="tw-pb-4"><strong>Platform Features </strong></h2>
    <p>
      <strong>No Code Creator Studio</strong> Wapal's in-built tooling allows
      creators to convert images into meta-data and hash lists and mint on Aptos
      without any coding requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>On-Chain Randomness </strong> What's the point of a mint if it's
      not random? Wapal uses the pseudo-random generator to enable minting
      randomly and thus prevent attackers from predicting and minting all the
      rare NFTs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cost Effective</strong> Wapal decreases the cost of launching NFT
      Collection on Aptos significantly by reducing the Gas Costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Unlimited Permanent Storage for NFTs </strong>Wapal will directly
      enable unlimited permanent storage of NFTs in Arweave through payment in
      APT.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Open-Source & Secure </strong>Wapal is powered by Mokshya
      "Platform"'s NFT Mint Candy Machine Smart Contract. Since it's open
      source, it's transparent and secure. The smart contract has been audited
      by Movebit.

    <p>
      <strong> Launchpad and Mint Pages</strong>. If you are a Creator, you will
      have the ability to launch your NFTs using a Launchpad and mintpages
      developed by Wapal where you can showcase your Creator Content and conduct
      initial sales of NFTs (“Mint Page”). The Creator Content you upload will

      If you are using the Platform to mint NFTs, you are a “Buyer,” and if you
      are using the Platform to launch NFTs, you are a “Seller.” “Revenue” means
      the gross amount paid by the Buyer to the Seller of the NFTs using the
      Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      (i) “Buyer” agrees to pay mint price and all other applicable fees,
      including Aptos Network fees and wallet fees during mint.

      authorize us to automatically charge "Seller“ for any such fees or deduct
      such fees (directly from amounts paid by the “Buyer”).
    </p>
    <p>
      (iii) If you are a “Seller”, you will receive “Revenue” less the “Platform
      Fee” for each sale of your NFT using the Platform. For eg: Seller list 1
      NFt in the platform launchpad for Buyer to mint, 1 APT is the mint price
      per NFT. Revenue is 1 APT. Therefore, Seller receives 0.97 APT, the
      Platform receives 0.03 APT, Buyer receives 1 NFT.
    </p>

      All amounts payable under these Terms are non-refundable and without
      set-off or counterclaim.  All Fees are exclusive of any taxes, levies, or

    <h3><strong> (i) General Terms</strong></h3>
    <p>
      These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements
      expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and
      exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Wapal regarding your
      use of the Platform. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your
      rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or
      otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at
      any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of
      any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any
      other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of
      these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any
      subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of
      Section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have
      any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms,
      the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to.” If
      any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
      unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible,
      and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.
    </p>
